# Chill Music Bot!

A discord bot that plays *one* song LOL

## Config

Create a file called `config.json` and add the following:

```json
{
    "token": "[discord bot token]",
    "prefix": "[prefix for bot commands (ie. '!')]",
}
```

Add a file named `music.mp3` to play on repeat (music won't play if this file doesn't exist!)
